GETTING STARTED
===============

    To compile Npgsql from cvs, do the following:
 
    Get Npgsql source from anon pgfoundry cvs:
    
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.pgfoundry.org:/cvsroot/npgsql login
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.pgfoundry.org:/cvsroot/npgsql checkout
 
    When prompted for a password for anonymous, simply press the Enter key.

    It will start download Npgsql sources in a folder called Npgsql.


COMPILING
=========

    1.) The standard compile method.
    To compile Npgsql, first get NAnt: nant.sf.net
    Go to Npgsql/src/Npgsql folder and execute NAnt from command line.

    >nant build
    
    It will create a folder called build/ms where you will find the two assemblies you need to run Npgsql: Npgsql.dll and the Tls library assembly. 
      
    2.) The method in Microsoft Visual Studio.
    under Npgsql/src Npgsql.csproj and Npgsql.sln can be used.
    however, VS2005 is automatically changed by the reason it was made from VS2003.  
    3.) The method in ShapeDevelop.
    under Npgsql/src Npgsql.csproj can be used by ShapeDevelop Version2.0.
    it is automatically changed. It seems that it uses the project file of VS2005.  
     
INSTALL
=======

    Just copy the resulting .dll's to application directory.
