The SocketEval folder contains a project group, intended for evaluation of .net socket programming issues. I have checked out especially the asynchronous programming techniques.

Whats going on inside?

The server app creates a listener object, listening on port 11000, waiting for an incoming connection.

The client connects to the server on port 11000. The connection request is recognized by the server in the Listener.AcceptCallback() method. The listener object then creates a session controller object and starts listening to the client. The messages sent by the client are echoed on the console.

The whole processing is done in the background, so the user interface remains reactive properly.

The files in this folder are uploaded in order to have the Npgsql developer team (and others, of course) a look in my ongoing work. It's not ready yet, so please be patient, essential functions will follow.
