        	- Added NpgsqlEventLog class to handle event & debug logging

        	NpgsqlConnection.cs
            		- Added some event/debug logging.

        	NpgsqlException.cs
            		- Added some event/debug logging.

	dpage:
        	NpgsqlConnection.cs
            		- Make connection strings case-insensitive
            		- Allow use of ODBC style UID & PWD options

	fxjr:
        	NpgsqlConnection.cs
            		- Some code cleanup.
            		- Fixed handling of AuthenticationRequest message to read the exact number of 
            		bytes (4). connection.ReceiveBufferSize crashed in Mono.
        
        	NpgsqlParameterCollection.cs
        		- Changed indexer this[String] implementation to call this[Int32] instead of
        		base[Int32] because Mono didn't compile it.
        	
        	- Now, Npgsql can be compiled and run in Mono. But just the connection estabilishment
        	is working.

	fxjr:
		NpgsqlCommand.cs
			- Fixed bug that prevented queries like 'select field, field from table' to
			work when used in the ExecuteScalar() method. Now, when doing a query that
			results in more than one row and/or field, only the value of the first row,
			first column is returned.
			- Changed implementation to use PGUtil class.
					
		NpgsqlConnection.cs
			- Changed implementation to use PGUtil class
			
		- Initial implementation of PGUtil class.
		- Added initial NAnt build file called Npgsql.build. Now, when build using NAnt,
		a directory build will be created. There is a clean task that can be also used.

	fxjr:
		NpgsqlCommand.cs
			- When a message is not handled in ExecuteScalar, the exception shows it.
			ExecuteScalar() is still crashing with select field, field from table.
			- Added limited support to strong type return value in the ExecuteScalar() 
			method. Only to int4 datatype on the database. It will be mapped to Int32.
			Any other type will be returned as String.
			- Fixed bug with ignoring other rows and columns. The last row was being 
			returned, if so.
			- Fixed bug with byteorder while handling RowDescription message in the
			ExecuteScalar() method.
			- Some code cleanup of the ExecuteScalar() method.
			- Fixed the hardcoded value of bytes to read in the handle of
			AsciiRow message. Now it reads the number of bytes that is necessary
			to hold the number of fields of the query.

	fxjr:
		NpgsqlConnection.cs
			- Created the encoding property so that NpgsqlCommand class and maybe others
			can use the encoding used in connection.
		NpgsqlCommand.cs
			- Finish a little functional ExecuteNonQuery() method.
			Now, you can execute some queries that don't return rows like insert, delete
			and update!! See status for more information.
			- Fixed ExecuteNonQuery so that commands like create table and others that
			don't return number of rows affected do not throw exception.
			- Finish a little functional ExecuteScalar() method. Now it is possible
			to execute queries like select count(*) from table. It is very unstable.
			
		- Added STATUS.txt file.
		
2002-05-24

	fxjr:
		NpgsqlCommand.cs
			- Created explicit interface implementation of property Parameters 
			IDataParameterCollection IDbCommand.Parameters.
			- Created a Parameters property that returns strong value NpgsqParameterCollection.
		
		NpgsqlParameter.cs
			- Created constructors NpgsqlParameter() and NpgsqlParameter(String, DbType)
		
		NpgsqlConnection.cs
			- Created internal property encoding to return the connection encoding.
			- Changed implementation of NpgsqlConnection() to call the NpgsqlConnection(String)
		
		
		- Changed ChangeLog format!
