	- Npgsql is now capable of sending some queries like select count(*) from table
	with NpgsqlCommand.ExecuteScalar() method. 
	Note that this method is yet very much instable. Queries like 
	"select field, field from table" still crashs it. :(

	- Npgsql is now capable of sending some queries like insert, update and delete.
	Note that parameters in these queries aren't work yet. So they must be 'full'
	queries like insert into <table> values (<value1>, <value2>, ...).
