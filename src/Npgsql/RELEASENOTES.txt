	First Npgsql beta release.
	In this version there is a limited functionality. It is only possible to
connect and disconnect from server.
	Only clear text authentication is supported right now.
	To compile you can use the SharpDevelop to open the Combine file (Npgsql.cmbx) or
type at command console: csc /t:library /out:Npgsql.dll NpgsqlConnection.cs AssemblyInfo.cs NpgsqlException.cs
This will create the file Npgsql.dll that can be copied to the application directory.

	I will be working in the Command functionality now.
	
	
	Play with it and send your bugs and comments :)
