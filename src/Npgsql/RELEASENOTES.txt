    Npgsql 0.5 development release.
    
    What's new in this version:
    
      - New datatypes supported: bool, int2, int4, int8, numeric, timestamp, date, time and text data types.
      These types are mapped to DbTtype enum: Boolean, Int16, Int32, Int64, Decimal,
      DateTime, Date, Time and String.
      
      - NpgsqlParameter now supports those types through the DbType enumeration and not just Int32, Int64
      
      - NpgsqlDataAdapter now has more helper contructors. Thanks stevenao for reporting this (Bug 455)
      
      - MD5 Authentication is now supported. Thanks Brar Piening. 
        Mono MD5 implementation is being used. Thanks Sebastien Pouliot.
        
      - NpgsqlDataAdapter can be used to select, insert, update and delete data with DataSets.
      
      - StrongType datasets generated with xsd can be used.
      
      - Support for Listen/Notify events through the NotificationEventHandler delegate and
        NpgsqlConnection.OnNotification event. Thanks Wojtek Wierzbicki. Now applications can 
        hook on it to receive notification messages from server. This notification is asynchronous which means they will
        be delivered to client apps in the next interaction of Npgsql with backend.
        
	- NUnit20 tests were added. There are 48 tests which can also be used as a source of references of new Npgsql functionality.
	Of course, new tests are very welcome :)
       
    
    Bugfixes:
    
      - Large resultsets are now correctly handled(Bug id 467). Thanks Chris Wenneman.
      - Null values handling are now fixed. Thanks Stuart Ballard for showing this problem.
      - Quotes in strings are now *actually* working. 
    
    
    This release is very stable and have a lot of immediate functionality is now working.
    It can be used in production environments. Please, get the non-debug releases to production use.
    Thanks all for help debugging and sending your bug reports and patches! :)

    Npgsql 0.2 development release.
    
    In this version we got many things working...
    
    - You can send insert, update, delete queries through NpgsqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery() method.
    - You can send queries like, select count(*) from table, select version() with 
      NpgsqlCommand.ExecuteScalar() method.
    - There is logging support. (Thanks Dave Page)
      To use it, place code like that in your program:
      
      // Enable logging.
	  NpgsqlEventLog.Level = LogLevel.Debug;            // LogLevel.
	  NpgsqlEventLog.LogName = "NpgsqlTests.LogFile";   // LogFile.
    
    - You can use Npgsql with Mono (Thanks Kristis Makris). It is not working perfectly. :( 
    - There is a winforms test suite (Thanks Dave Page).
    - Clearer code in NpgsqlConnection removing *magic* numbers and constants. (Thanks Kristis Makris)
    - Better support of ODBC-like ConnectionString in NpgsqlConnection (Thanks Dave Page)
    - Thanks Ulrich Sprick for all discussion and ideas.
    
    And much more to come! 
    Thanks all team !

	First Npgsql beta release.
	In this version there is a limited functionality. It is only possible to
connect and disconnect from server.
	Only clear text authentication is supported right now.
	To compile you can use the SharpDevelop to open the Combine file (Npgsql.cmbx) or
type at command console: csc /t:library /out:Npgsql.dll NpgsqlConnection.cs AssemblyInfo.cs NpgsqlException.cs
This will create the file Npgsql.dll that can be copied to the application directory.

	I will be working in the Command functionality now.
	
	
	Play with it and send your bugs and comments :)
